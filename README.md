HMRC's [**MTD** (Making Tax Digital)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-tax-digital-for-vat) has opened a number of API endpoints to developers.

The [**VAT-MTD** endpoint](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/vat-api/1.0#endpoints) allows us to create, amend and submit VAT returns for companies authenticated with the service.

Thus, as an ode to [100% Free VAT Bridge](http://www.comsci.co.uk/100PcVatFreeBridge.html), we decided to try and create a comparable tool in Ruby (using the Sinatra web framework).

### üíª Code

Written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) with the [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) web framework.

Has several modules:

- **Authentication**

  Uses warden to provide session-logging. This enables us to store passwords & user credentials & validate against them when the user tries to log in.

- **oAuth**

  Connects to MTD authentication endpoint to provide system with the ability to interact with the client's VAT account.

- **Returns**

  Interacts with the VAT-MTD "[GET] Returns" endpoint to list the most recent VAT returns for users.

- **Submissions**

  Creates new submission for the client, using data from an uploaded XLS (Excel) spreadsheet.

-

Goal was to make a system which:

1. Authenticates with the VAT-MTD service
2. Is able to populate the authenticated client's previous returns
3. Is able to submit new returns, populated with data from XLS (Excel) spreadsheets
4. Can validate the success of said returns
